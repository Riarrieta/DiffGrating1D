## DiffGrating1D
An implementation of the Boundary Integral Equation Neumann-to-Dirichlet map method (BIE-NtD), proposed by Wu and Lu [(link)](https://opg.optica.org/josaa/fulltext.cfm?uri=josaa-26-11-2444&id=188334), for the computation of reflection and transmission coefficients of 1D-periodic gratings and photonic crystal (PhC) slabs.
